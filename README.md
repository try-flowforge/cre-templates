# CRE Templates

A curated set of ready-to-run examples for the **Chainlink Runtime Environment (CRE)**:

- **Building Blocks** – tiny, focused workflows that teach one concept at a time (on-chain reads, off-chain calls, secrets, scheduling, etc.).
- **Starter Templates** – opinionated, end-to-end workflows that combine multiple capabilities and look closer to real-world use cases.

Use these as references or starting points to compose your own production workflows.

## Repository Structure

### Building Blocks

Small, focused examples. Each directory includes its own README.

- **`building-blocks/kv-store`** – Read/modify/write a value in **AWS S3** using SigV4-signed HTTP requests, CRE secrets, and a **consensus read → single write** flow.
- **`building-blocks/read-data-feeds`** – Read `decimals()` and `latestAnswer()` from **Chainlink Data Feeds** on a schedule; includes ABI/bindings and RPC config examples.

### Starter Templates

More complex, end-to-end workflows. Each directory includes its own README (some marked **WIP**).

- **`starter-template/custom-data-feed`** – Fetch off-chain data (HTTP) and **push updates on-chain**; shows cron scheduling, secrets, bindings, and chain writes.
- **`starter-template/bring-your-own-data`** – NAV (Net Asset Value) & PoR (Proof of Reserve) templates for publishing your own data on-chain.
- **`starter-template/multi-chain-token-manager`** – Orchestrate token operations and state across **multiple chains**.

---

## When to Use Which

- **Building Blocks**
  Use these when you want to learn a **single concept quickly** (e.g., secrets + HTTP signing, reading a data feed, cron triggers). Great for copy/paste into your project.

- **Starter Templates**
  Choose these when you want a **runnable reference architecture** that strings together multiple steps (off-chain + on-chain), includes contracts/bindings, and mirrors real workflows.
