# Custom Data Feed – CRE Template (TypeScript)

A template for bringing your own **custom off-chain data feed** on-chain with the **Chainlink Runtime Environment (CRE)** using **TypeScript** and **Bun**.

---

**⚠️ DISCLAIMER**

This template is an educational example to demonstrate how to interact with Chainlink systems, products, and services. It is provided **“AS IS”** and **“AS AVAILABLE”** without warranties of any kind, has **not** been audited, and may omit checks or error handling for clarity. **Do not use this code in production** without performing your own audits and applying best practices. Neither Chainlink Labs, the Chainlink Foundation, nor Chainlink node operators are responsible for unintended outputs generated due to errors in code.

## What This Template Does

This template provides an end-to-end starting point for bringing your own **custom data feed** on-chain with the **Chainlink Runtime Environment (CRE)**. It showcases local simulation and the core CRE workflow patterns.

**Components:**

* **Contracts** (Solidity) under `projectRoot/contracts/evm/src`  
  Example demo contracts used by the workflow:
  * `ReserveManager`
  * `SimpleERC20`
  * `BalanceReader`
  * `MessageEmitter`
* **CRE Workflow** (**TypeScript**) that fetches your off-chain data and optionally performs chain writes based on configurable triggers (cron or EVM log). The entry point is typically `main.ts`.

**Key Technologies**

* **CRE (Chainlink Runtime Environment)** – orchestrates workflows with DON consensus.
* **TypeScript + Bun** – authoring and running the workflow locally.

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Update .env file

You need to add a private key to the `.env` file. This is specifically required if you want to simulate **chain writes** (the key must be valid and funded).  
If your workflow does **not** write on-chain, you can keep a dummy key:

```bash
CRE_ETH_PRIVATE_KEY=0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001
````

### 2. Install dependencies

If **Bun** is not already installed, follow the instructions at: [https://bun.com/docs/installation](https://bun.com/docs/installation)

From your project root, run:

```bash
bun install --cwd ./my-workflow
```

### 3. Configure RPC endpoints

For local simulation to interact with a chain, specify RPC endpoints for the chains you interact with in `project.yaml`. This is required for submitting transactions and reading blockchain state.

Supported for local simulation (testnet/mainnet variants):

* Ethereum (`ethereum-testnet-sepolia`, `ethereum-mainnet`)
* Base (`ethereum-testnet-sepolia-base-1`, `ethereum-mainnet-base-1`)
* Avalanche (`avalanche-testnet-fuji`, `avalanche-mainnet`)
* Polygon (`polygon-testnet-amoy`, `polygon-mainnet`)
* BNB Chain (`binance-smart-chain-testnet`, `binance-smart-chain-mainnet`)
* Arbitrum (`ethereum-testnet-sepolia-arbitrum-1`, `ethereum-mainnet-arbitrum-1`)
* Optimism (`ethereum-testnet-sepolia-optimism-1`, `ethereum-mainnet-optimism-1`)

Add your RPCs under `rpcs` (example):

```yaml
rpcs:
  - chain-name: ethereum-testnet-sepolia
    url: <Your RPC endpoint to ETH Sepolia>
```

> For chain names, see the selectors list:
> [https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chain-selectors/blob/main/selectors.yml](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chain-selectors/blob/main/selectors.yml)

### 4. Deploy contracts

Deploy the demo contracts: **BalanceReader**, **MessageEmitter**, **ReserveManager**, **SimpleERC20**.
You can deploy to a local chain or a testnet using tools like Foundry.

For a quick start, you can also use the pre-deployed contract addresses on Ethereum Sepolia—no action required if you’re just trying things out.

### 5. Configure workflow

Configure `config.json` for the workflow:

* `schedule`: e.g. `"*/30 * * * * *"` (every 30 seconds), or any cron you prefer
* `url`: your off-chain data endpoint (custom data feed)
* `tokenAddress`: `SimpleERC20` contract address
* `porAddress`: `ReserveManager` contract address
* `proxyAddress`: `UpdateReservesProxySimplified` contract address
* `balanceReaderAddress`: `BalanceReader` contract address
* `messageEmitterAddress`: `MessageEmitter` contract address
* `chainSelectorName`: human-readable chain name (see selectors YAML linked above)
* `gasLimit`: gas limit used for chain writes

Ensure `workflow.yaml` points to the config (example):

```yaml
staging-settings:
  user-workflow:
    workflow-name: "my-workflow"
  workflow-artifacts:
    workflow-path: "./main.ts"
    config-path: "./config.json"
    secrets-path: ""
```

### 6. Simulate the workflow

Run the command from the **project root** and pass the **path to the workflow directory**:

```bash
cre workflow simulate <path-to-workflow-directory>
```

Example (for `my-workflow`):

```bash
cre workflow simulate my-workflow
```

You’ll see trigger options similar to:

```bash
🚀 Workflow simulation ready. Please select a trigger:
1. cron-trigger@1.0.0 Trigger
2. evm:ChainSelector:16015286601757825753@1.0.0 LogTrigger
```

* **Cron Trigger**: choose `1` → the workflow executes on the schedule.
* **Log Trigger**: choose `2`, then provide the example inputs:

```bash
Transaction Hash: 0x420721d7d00130a03c5b525b2dbfd42550906ddb3075e8377f9bb5d1a5992f8e
Log Event Index: 0
```

Example output:

```bash
🔗 EVM Trigger Configuration:
Please provide the transaction hash and event index for the EVM log event.
Enter transaction hash (0x...): 0x420721d7d00130a03c5b525b2dbfd42550906ddb3075e8377f9bb5d1a5992f8e

```

## Security Considerations

**⚠️ Important Notes**

1. **Demo project** – Not production-ready.
2. **Demo contracts** – Not audited; do not use as-is in production.
3. **Use your own RPCs** – For stability and performance, prefer private RPCs for deployment and chain writes.
4. **Secrets hygiene** – Keep real secrets out of version control; use secure secret managers for `.env` values.
