# Key-Value Store (AWS S3) - CRE Building Blocks

A minimal example that, on a cron schedule, reads a value from an **AWS S3 object**, increments it, and writes it back—using **CRE (Chainlink Runtime Environment)** with SigV4-signed HTTP requests.

The workflow:

- Retrieves `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` from CRE Secrets
- Signs the request with AWS **SigV4** (timestamp sourced from the consensus runtime)
- Reads the S3 object (initializes to `0` if missing)
- Aggregates the **current value** across nodes (median), increments once, and writes the **agreed next value** back

---

## Setup & Run

### 1) Provide AWS credentials as secrets

Add the following secrets to your CRE environment:

```bash
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
````

(For local testing, ensure these are available to the simulator via your environment variables.)

### 2) Configure the workflow

Create/update `my-workflow/config.json` with your S3 details:

```json
{
  "schedule": "* * */1 * * *",
  "aws_region": "my-aws-region",
  "s3_bucket": "product-release-bucket",
  "s3_key": "cre-counter.txt"
}
````

- `schedule` uses a **6-field** cron expression with seconds (e.g., `* * */1 * * *` runs every hour).
- `aws_region` is the AWS region of your bucket.
- `s3_bucket` is the bucket name.
- `s3_key` is the object path that stores the counter.

### 3) Run a local simulation

From your project root:

```bash
cre workflow simulate my-workflow
```

You should see output similar to:

```bash
