# CRE Templates – Building Blocks

Small, focused examples showing how to use the **Chainlink Runtime Environment (CRE)** to interact with **on-chain** and/or **off-chain** components. Each block is a self-contained workflow with a short README and runnable config so you can learn by doing.

## What are Building Blocks?

Each block demonstrates a single CRE capability or pattern (e.g., reading on-chain data, writing to an off-chain service, using secrets, scheduling with cron). Use them as learning references or as starting points to compose your own workflows.

**Common traits:**

- Minimal code focused on one task
- Clear configuration via `config.json`
- Runnable locally with `cre workflow simulate`
- Documented prerequisites and expected output

---

## Available Blocks

### 1) **Key-Value Store (AWS S3)**

Path: [`./kv-store`](./kv-store)

- Reads a value from an **AWS S3 object**, increments it, and writes it back.
- Uses CRE secrets (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`) and **SigV4** signing.
- Performs a **consensus read** of the current value across nodes, then writes the agreed next value.

👉 See the block’s README for setup, config, and sample logs.

---

### 2) **Read Data Feeds**

Path: [`./read-data-feeds`](./read-data-feeds)

- On a cron schedule, reads `decimals()` and `latestAnswer()` from **Chainlink Data Feeds** (example targets BTC/USD and ETH/USD on Arbitrum One).
- Shows how to add an ABI, generate Go bindings, configure chain RPC, and log scaled answers.

👉 See the block’s README for setup, config, and sample logs.

---

## When to Use Which Block

- **kv-store**: You want to see an **off-chain write** pattern (AWS S3), secrets usage, SigV4 signing, and a **consensus read → single write** flow.
- **read-data-feeds**: You want to **read on-chain data** via contract calls, manage ABIs/bindings, and configure **RPC** access.
